#  Binary to Hex and Decimal on Pi Pico

## Project description

The goal of this project is to create a Learning PCB board that will allow you to convert an 8-bit binary number to Decimal or Hexadecimal.
The board has 11 inputs, which include 8 buttons to select from bit 0 - 7, an add, subtract and reset button.
This will allow you set the bit high or low in an 8 bit number which will indicate through the LED - by turning LED on for 1 and off for a 0.
The Pico will take the 8 bit number and convert it into decimal and hexadecimal.

The 16x2 character LCD display will be used as output to indicate the results.
The LED will display the decimal, hexadecimal and binary number.
